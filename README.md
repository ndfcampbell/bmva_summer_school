- Load the PyTorch_Example file first and then take a look at the linear regression lab!

## Extension:

- If you are curious as to how PyTorch (and similar libraries) work behind the scenes then please take a look at the Scalar Auto Grad Demo file!

## Advanced:

- If you are already familiar with PyTorch then you may be interested in the advanced notebook on Vision Foundation Models kindly provided by [Li (Luis) Li](https://www.luisli.org); please see the instructions within the file, in particular using GPU acceleration when loading on the colab server.
